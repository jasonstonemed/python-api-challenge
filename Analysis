Temperature vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot- both Northern and Southern Hemispheres demonstrated the same -0.77 correllation coefficient indicating virtually no relationship. It is also noted that, in both hemispheres, the data trend changed in similarly opposite directions at approximately 20 degress latitude

Humidity vs. Latitude - As with the first regression, the course of the data over latitude changes trends in approximately an equal and opposite direction. Again, this occurs at approximately 20 degress latitude. At 0.16 and 0.26, there is no indication of correllation.

Cloudiness vs. Latitude- Latitude continues to indicate no correllation with selected weather condition. Cloudiness in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres had same regression values of 0.07

Wind Speed vs. Latitude- Again, no correllation betweeh wind speed and latitude with either hemisphere; Northern = 0.18, Southern= -0.29
THe evidence presented here indicates that latitude is not demonstrating any effect on the conditions reported at the time of data collection.
